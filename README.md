# Summer2018MachineLearningProject
Please view my power point document for information on the project. 
This was my first time working with machine learning. I learned a lot from reading Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems by Aurélien Géron. Additionally I read many research papers given to me by my mentor. 
This project was very challenging but I am proud of what I learned in one summer.
